The RACE & ADVENTURE AND LIFE

WHAT IS BEST ADVENTURE U WANT TO GO ON??
Road to LONDON 2027

Life is like a race, you keep on running. You try to get as fast as possible however, it is the special race , it's a race against time , not everyone can run long time, some have many years left , some may have minutes , but the point is running as fast as you can before your time runs out

I’m busy;
but not in the way
most people accept.
I’m busy calming my fear
and finding my courage.
I’m busy listening to my kids.
I’m busy getting in touch
with what is real.
I’m busy growing things and
connecting with the natural world.
I’m busy questioning my answers.
I’m busy being present in my life.

WHY DO U WANT TO GO?
To Discover my true potential!!!
